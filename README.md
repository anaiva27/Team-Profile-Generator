## Description  
The application dynamically generates a team profile summary, that asks employees certain questions, to create a page with cards containing that info and live links to employees GitHub pages as well. The app works as a template, that user will fill up by answering questions inside the command line in Node.
<br><br> 

## Installation
To run this application, the user will need to install `Inquirer.js`, which is a command line interface package for Node.js that initiates the process of asking questions, providing error feedback, validating answers and other query-based tasks.
Also the user is going to need `package.json` that will hold various metadata relevant to the project. This file is used to give information to npm that allows it to identify the project as well as how to handle the project's dependencies.
To install all dependancies use command: 
```
npm i
``` 
<br>

## Usage 

The user can invoke this application by opening the app.js file in the Node command line by typing `node app.js`. Then the user(manager) will be prompted with a series of questions about his id, name and some personal information inside the command line. After the questions have been answered, the manager will get an option to add more employees(engineers or interns) or finish adding. If the last option has been chosen, the manager will get a confirmation message `"Team summary has been generated"`. The file will be located in the folder `Output` and will be named `Team.html`.<br>
The profile page can be opened in a browser window and has been styled accordingly to a chosen theme, that can be changed by editing the file `style.css` located in the same folder. 
The files containing classes with the info about the employees (name, email, id, school, GitHub name etc), that needs to be collected, are located in the folder `lib` in the root directory, can be easily modified, if needed. 
<br><br>

## Testing
The app was tested using framework Jest, that simply checks the instance properties after classes were initialized.<br> 
Here's a screenshot of the testing log: <br><br>
